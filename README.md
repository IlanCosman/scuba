> ðŸ¤¿ Scuba - It's how you swim with the [fish][]

Scuba is a minimal plugin manager for the friendly interactive shell. Extend your shell's capabilities, change the look of your prompt, and create repeatable configurations across systems.

- Oh My Fish and Fisher plugin support.
- Zero configuration out of the box.
- Robust install, update, and uninstall event system.

## Installation

### System requirements

- [curl][]
- [fish][] â‰¥ 3.1

#### Bootstrap scuba

```console
curl -sL https://git.io/scuba-install | source && _scuba_sub_install ilancosman/scuba
```

## Quickstart

### Installing plugins

Install plugins using the `install` command followed by the path to the repository on GitHub. The shell is restarted after installing plugins, so you can start using them immediately.

```console
scuba install rafaelrinaldi/pure
```

For a specific version of a plugin add an `@` symbol after the plugin name followed by the tag, branch, or commit. Only one plugin version can be installed at any given time.

```console
scuba install patrickf3139/fzf.fish@v4.1
```

You can add plugins from local directories too.

```console
scuba install ~/path/to/my/fish/plugin
```

### Listing plugins

List all explicitly installed plugins using the `list` command.

```console
scuba list
ilancosman/scuba
rafaelrinaldi/pure
patrickf3139/fzf.fish@v4.1
~/path/to/my/fish/plugin
```

> `ilanCosman/scuba` is listed because you installed it to start with!

### Updating plugins

Update plugins using the `update` command. If given no arguments, `scuba update` will update all installed plugins, including scuba itself.

```console
scuba update
```

### Removing plugins

Remove plugins using the `remove` command.

```console
scuba remove rafaelrinaldi/pure
```

Since scuba is just like any other plugin, you can uninstall it using `scuba remove ilancosman/scuba`.
