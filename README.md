> ðŸ¤¿ Scuba - It's how you swim with the [fish][]

Scuba is a minimal plugin manager for the friendly interactive shell. Extend your shell's capabilities, change the look of your prompt, and create repeatable configurations across systems.

- Oh My Fish and Fisher plugin support.
- Minimal and elegant design following fish philosophy.
- Install, update, and uninstall event system.

## Bootstrap Scuba

```console
curl -sL https://git.io/scuba-install | source && _scuba_sub_install ilancosman/scuba
```

## Quickstart

### Installing plugins

Install plugins using the `install` command followed by the path to the repository on GitHub.

```console
scuba install rafaelrinaldi/pure
```

For a specific version of a plugin add an `@` symbol after the plugin name followed by the tag, branch, or commit.

```console
scuba install patrickf3139/fzf.fish@v4.1
```

You can add plugins from local directories too.

```console
scuba install ~/path/to/my/fish/plugin
```

### Listing plugins

List installed plugins using the `list` command.

```console
scuba list
ilancosman/scuba
rafaelrinaldi/pure
patrickf3139/fzf.fish@v4.1
/home/ilan/path/to/my/fish/plugin
```

> `ilancosman/scuba` is listed because you installed it to start with!

You can use a regular expression after `list` to refine the output.

```console
scuba list '^/'
/home/ilan/path/to/my/fish/plugin
```

### Updating plugins

Update plugins using the `update` command. `update` by itself will update all installed plugins, including scuba itself.

```console
scuba update
```

### Removing plugins

Remove plugins using the `remove` command.

```console
scuba remove rafaelrinaldi/pure
```

Since scuba is just like any other plugin, you can uninstall it using `scuba remove ilancosman/scuba`.
