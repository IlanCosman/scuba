## Installation

### System requirements

- [Git][]
- [Fish][] â‰¥ 3.0

#### Bootstrap scuba

```console
curl -L git.io/scuba-install | source && _scuba_sub_install IlanCosman/scuba
```

## Quickstart

You've found an interesting utility you'd like to try out, or maybe you've [created a new plugin][]. How do you install it? How do you update or remove it?

### Installing plugins

Install plugins using the `install` command followed by the path to the repository on GitHub. The shell is restarted after installing plugins, so you can start using them immediately.

```console
scuba install rafaelrinaldi/pure
```

For a specific version of a plugin add an `@` symbol after the plugin name followed by the tag, branch, or commit. Only one plugin version can be installed at any given time.

```console
scuba install patrickf3139/fzf.fish@v4.1
```

You can add plugins from local directories too. Local plugins will be installed using symlinks, so changes to the original files will be reflected in new shell sessions.

```console
scuba install ~/path/to/local/plugin
```

### Listing plugins

List all explicitly installed plugins using the `list` command.

```console
scuba list
rafaelrinaldi/pure
patrickf3139/fzf.fish@v4.1
~/path/to/myfish/plugin
```

### Updating plugins

Update plugins using the `update` command, which checks if the given plugins are out of date and updates them if necessary. If given no arguments, `scuba update` updates all installed plugins, including scuba itself.

```console
scuba update rafaelrinaldi/pure
```

### Removing plugins

Remove plugins using the `remove` command. If a plugin has dependencies, they too will be removed unless required for another plugin.

```console
scuba remove rafaelrinaldi/pure
```

Since scuba is just a plugin, you can uninstall it using `scuba remove IlanCosman/scuba`
