## Code Conventions

### Style Guide

- `if` > `and` or `or`
- `test` > `[...]`
- `printf` > `echo`
- Long forms of flags > short forms
  - Exceptions: `set`, `function foo -a`, "common knowledge" options for commands like `rm -R`, `complete`
  - Note that MacOS utils often do not support long flags, in which case one should use the short option
- Piping > command substitution (only when convenient, i.e no extra commands)

### Naming Conventions

Local variables should be named in `camelCase`.

- `set -l nameEscaped`

Anything exposed to the shell or user--functions, global/universal variables, and files--should be named in `snake_case`, beginning with `scuba_`. Prepend an underscore if the user in not meant to interact directly with it.

- `scuba.fish`
- `set -U _scuba_plugins`

#### Specific Naming Conventions

- Subcommands begin with `_scuba_sub_`
